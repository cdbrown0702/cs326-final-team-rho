### Division of Labor
We plan on making 3 separate webpages for our app - one for the map, one for a list view of the reports, and one page to submit a report. Each person will write part of the data interactions, wireframes, and code for their respective page. 
- Connor: map page
- James: list view page
- Nitant: submit report page
