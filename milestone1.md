# Milestone 1

## Data Interactions
First opening the website directs you to an interactive map of UMass's campus. This map will have markers, with different colors and labels corresponding to the type of report, for areas in which reports have been made (designated during reporting by the user). Its interactions include being able to zoom in and slide around the map, with users being able to click directly on a marker and display a pop-up containing information regarding said report.

### Division of Labor
We plan on making 3 separate webpages for our app - one for the map, one for a list view of the reports, and one page to submit a report. Each person will write their respective part of the data interactions, wireframes, and code for their respective page. 
- Connor: map page
- James: list view page
- Nitant: submit report page
