# What does it do?

UAlert is designed to be both an interactive map and a forum for UMass students, with the purpose of offering a platform for all eyes and ears to report what they see and hear within the UMass community. Campus on-goings, potential problems for daily travels, anything that someone thinks needs to be heard! For example, imagine you are walking to class and are delayed by construction on a path you typically take to save time on your daily walk (think of the Student Union construction from a couple years ago). Within a couple of minutes, everyone in the UMass community can become aware of such a problem; and they won't just see words and descriptions, they'll get a literal location on the Campus map to help. This doesn't include just construction, but also group meetings, building closures, BabyBerk sightings, car accidents, etc. UAlert will be a top-down look at our community, allowing literally anyone to be aware, and prepared, for anything that may come their way.
