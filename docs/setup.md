## Setup

- Necessary Pieces:
*server.js - contains server
*minicrypt.js - used for encryption
*client/scripts dir (listview.js, map.js, report.js) - contains scripting for all 3 main UI pages, back-end
*client dir (listview.html, login.html, map.html, register.html, report.html, main.css) - contains all frameworks and main stylesheet for our front-end

- Our database is implemented in MongoDB, which is setup strictly through Heroku, which has our connection key saved secretly.
