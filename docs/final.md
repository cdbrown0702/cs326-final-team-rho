## Fall 2021

## Overview

UAlert is an application that allows UMass students the ability to document any campus occurrences, including but not limited to car accidents, police encounters, community events, and more. On a campus flooded with different people with varied methods of information, it is vital to have a centralized application to keep the entire population informed. Thus, UAlert serves as a safe, efficient and user-oriented platform for awareness.
